pxForge scans your project recursively, analyzes every file with an LLM, and outputs a structured context document you can drop directly into any AI coding assistant — Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or Cursor.

## What It Does

Most AI assistants don't know your codebase. You paste snippets, explain context, repeat yourself. pxForge fixes that.

It walks your entire project, reads every file, and produces a single Markdown document containing:

- A high-level project summary
- Your full directory tree
- Per-file breakdowns (purpose, logic, dependencies)
- A ready-to-use system prompt tailored to your exact codebase

Paste it once. Your AI assistant is now a collaborator who actually knows the code.

---

## Features

- **Recursive scanning** — walks the full project tree, skips binaries, build artifacts, and lock files automatically
- **LLM-powered analysis** — every file is analyzed for purpose, key functions, dependencies, and non-obvious logic
- **Multi-provider support** — works with OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Groq, OpenRouter, and Ollama (local)
- **Ollama auto-detection** — detects every model you have pulled locally, no API key required
- **Parallel processing** — files are analyzed concurrently with provider-aware rate limiting
- **Smart chunking** — large files are split, analyzed in parts, then merged into a single coherent summary
- **`.gitignore` aware** — automatically respects the project's `.gitignore` so custom virtual environments, build output, and local config files are never analyzed
- **Fast file I/O** — optimized reading with binary detection and concurrent disk access
- **Cross-platform** — runs natively on Linux, macOS, and Windows with platform-specific clipboard and path handling
- **Open with AI** — one-click buttons open Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and more directly in your browser
- **Team share link** — upload the prompt as a private GitHub Gist and copy a link for your teammates
- **Token estimator** — shows approximate token count before you paste
- **Saves your config** — API keys, provider, model, and preferred AI are remembered between runs
- **Terminal UI** — fully interactive TUI built with Textual, no browser required

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, Git

> **Quick check:** `python --version` or `python3 --version` — must be 3.10 or higher.

---

### Linux

**Debian / Ubuntu / Mint**

```bash
# Clipboard support
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git xclip          # X11
# or
sudo apt install -y git wl-clipboard   # Wayland

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/byte4day/PxForge.git
cd PxForge
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 pxforge.py install
```

**Arch / Manjaro**

```bash
sudo pacman -S git xclip     # X11
# or
sudo pacman -S git wl-clipboard  # Wayland

git clone https://github.com/byte4day/PxForge.git
cd PxForge
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 pxforge.py install
```

**Fedora / RHEL / CentOS**

```bash
sudo dnf install -y git xclip

git clone https://github.com/byte4day/PxForge.git
cd PxForge
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 pxforge.py install
```

Reload your shell after installing:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # bash
source ~/.zshrc    # zsh
exec fish          # fish
```

The `install` command writes a wrapper script to `~/.local/bin/pxforge` and adds it to your `PATH` automatically.

---

### macOS

**Homebrew (recommended)**

```bash
# Install Python if needed
brew install python git

git clone https://github.com/byte4day/PxForge.git
cd PxForge
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 pxforge.py install
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Without Homebrew**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/byte4day/PxForge.git
cd PxForge
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python pxforge.py install
source ~/.zshrc
```

Clipboard support works out of the box via `pbcopy` — no extra dependencies needed. If you use Fish shell: `exec fish` instead of sourcing a profile.

---

### Windows

**Option 1 — PowerShell (recommended)**

Open PowerShell as a regular user (no admin required):

```powershell
# Install Python from the Microsoft Store or python.org if not already installed
# Then:

git clone https://github.com/byte4day/PxForge.git
cd PxForge
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python pxforge.py install
```

The `install` command adds pxForge to `%APPDATA%\pxforge\` and registers it in your user `PATH`. Restart PowerShell, then run:

```powershell
pxforge .
```

**Option 2 — Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)**

If you have WSL2 set up, the Linux install path works identically inside your WSL environment. Clipboard integration between WSL and Windows requires `clip.exe`, which is available by default in WSL2.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/byte4day/PxForge.git
cd PxForge
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 pxforge.py install
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Option 3 — CMD**

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/byte4day/PxForge.git
cd PxForge
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python pxforge.py install
```

Restart CMD, then `pxforge` is available globally.

> **Windows note:** Clipboard support uses `pyperclip` on Windows, which requires no extra system packages. If you hit a `pyperclip` error, run `pip install pyperclip`.

---

### Without installing to PATH

Works on all platforms — no install step needed:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
python3 pxforge.py .
python3 pxforge.py /path/to/project

# Windows
python pxforge.py .
python pxforge.py C:\Users\you\myproject
```

---

## Usage

```bash
pxforge                  # launch with interactive directory picker
pxforge .                # scan current directory
pxforge /path/to/project # scan a specific project
pxforge install          # install the pxforge CLI command
pxforge --help           # show help
```

On Windows, the same commands work in PowerShell, CMD, and Windows Terminal.

---

## First Run

1. Launch `pxforge` or point it at a directory
2. Select your **provider** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, OpenRouter, or Ollama)
3. Enter your **API key** — saved to `~/.pxforge/config.json` for future runs *(not required for Ollama)*
4. Pick a **model** and **mode** (Fast or High Quality)
5. Choose your **preferred AI** for one-click output viewing
6. Hit **Start Scan**

When complete, the output screen gives you options to:

- Save to `pxforge_output.md` in the scanned directory
- Copy the full prompt to clipboard
- Open any supported AI directly in your browser with the prompt pre-copied

> **Config location by platform:**
> - Linux / macOS: `~/.pxforge/config.json`
> - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.pxforge\config.json`

---

## Using Ollama (Local Models)

pxForge supports fully local inference via [Ollama](https://ollama.com) — no API key, no cost, no data leaving your machine.

**Setup (Linux / macOS)**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

ollama pull llama3
ollama pull mistral
ollama pull codellama

ollama serve
```

**Setup (Windows)**

Download the installer from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and run it. Then in PowerShell:

```powershell
ollama pull llama3
ollama pull mistral
ollama serve
```

**In pxForge:**

1. Select **Ollama (Local)** as the provider
2. pxForge auto-detects all downloaded models — no API key needed
3. A live status indicator shows whether Ollama is reachable
4. Hit **↻ Refresh** to re-detect models after pulling new ones

> **Note:** Local models process files sequentially (concurrency = 2). Large projects will take longer than cloud providers — use a capable model like `llama3`, `mistral`, or `codellama` for best results.

## What Gets Ignored

pxForge automatically skips files and directories that add noise:

**Directories:** `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `venv`, `env`, `.tox`, `.nox`, `.mypy_cache`, `.pytest_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, `site-packages`, `htmlcov`, `.terraform`, `.serverless`, `.coverage`, `.next`, `.nuxt`, `out`, `.gradle`, `.idea`, `.vscode`, `vendor`, `target`, and more

**File types:** images, videos, audio, fonts, compiled binaries, archives, lock files, minified assets

**Large files:** anything over 500KB is skipped with a note

**`.gitignore` patterns:** If your project has a `.gitignore`, pxForge respects it automatically. Custom virtual environments, local env files, build artifacts, and anything else you already ignore will be skipped without wasting API tokens.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+S` | Save output to file |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Copy output to clipboard |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |
| `Escape` | Cancel scan in progress |

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.10+ |
| Terminal UI | [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) |
| HTTP client | [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) |
| Concurrency | asyncio |

---

## Configuration

Config is stored at `~/.pxforge/config.json` (Linux/macOS) or `%USERPROFILE%\.pxforge\config.json` (Windows) and persists:

- API keys per provider
- Last used provider and model
- Last used mode (fast / high quality)
- Preferred AI service for browser open

Ollama does not store any credentials — it connects to `http://localhost:11434` automatically.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`pxforge: command not found` after install**
Reload your shell (`source ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.zshrc`, or restart your terminal). On Windows, open a new PowerShell window.

**Clipboard not working on Linux**
Install `xclip` (X11) or `wl-clipboard` (Wayland) via your package manager. Confirm your session type with `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`.

**Textual fails to render on Windows CMD**
Use Windows Terminal or PowerShell — CMD has limited ANSI support. WSL2 works without any restrictions.

**`pip install` fails due to permissions**
Add `--user` flag: `pip install --user -r requirements.txt`. Never use `sudo pip` on a system Python.

**Ollama not detected**
Ensure `ollama serve` is running. Confirm it's reachable: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`. Hit **↻ Refresh** in the provider screen.

**Large project times out**
Switch to Fast mode or use a smaller Ollama model. Cloud providers (Groq, OpenRouter) handle parallel file analysis significantly faster than local inference.

## Philosophy

> If something slows you down twice, automate it.

pxForge exists because pasting context into AI assistants manually is tedious, error-prone, and doesn't scale. One command should be enough to make any AI fully aware of any codebase.
